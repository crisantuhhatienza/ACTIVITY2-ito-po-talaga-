# Given probabilities
P_M = 0.10          # Probability of measles
P_F = 0.90          # Probability of flu
P_R_given_M = 0.95  # Probability of rash given measles
P_R_given_F = 0.08  # Probability of rash given flu

# Calculate P(R) using the law of total probability
P_R = P_R_given_M * P_M + P_R_given_F * P_F

# Calculate P(M|R) using Bayes' theorem
P_M_given_R = (P_R_given_M * P_M) / P_R
